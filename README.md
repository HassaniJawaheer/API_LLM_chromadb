# API to communicate with your notes
Creation of an API with fastapi, which takes a question as input and fetches the answer in a document (txt or pdf). To seek the answer, I split the document into several chunks (of 500 tokens maximum) using CharacterTextsplitter and RecursiveTextSplitter for to divide documents. Then I use vector database (ChromaDB), OpenAIEmbedding (for txt) and SentencetransformersEmbedding (for pdf) for vectorization. Finally, to generate the answer I use the open AI LLM model with the "stuff" or "map_reduce" for chain model.
